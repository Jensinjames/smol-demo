Shared dependencies and elements across the generated files for the Reddit web scraper using Scrapy:

1. `scrapy.cfg`:
   - No direct shared dependencies, but it configures the Scrapy project settings.

2. `__init__.py` files:
   - Typically empty, used to indicate Python package directories.

3. `items.py`:
   - `RedditItem`: A Scrapy `Item` class that defines the data structure for scraped data.

4. `middlewares.py`:
   - `UserAgentMiddleware`: If created, a middleware to rotate user-agent strings.
   - `ProxyMiddleware`: If created, a middleware to handle proxy settings.

5. `pipelines.py`:
   - `JsonWriterPipeline`: A pipeline to serialize and store items into JSON files.

6. `settings.py`:
   - `BOT_NAME`: The name of the bot.
   - `SPIDER_MODULES`: List of modules where spiders are located.
   - `NEWSPIDER_MODULE`: Module where new spiders should reside.
   - `USER_AGENT`: Default user-agent string for the scraper.
   - `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY`: Boolean to indicate if robots.txt rules should be followed.
   - `ITEM_PIPELINES`: A dictionary defining the item pipelines and their order.

7. `spiders/__init__.py`:
   - Typically empty, used to indicate Python package directories.

8. `spiders/reddit_spider.py`:
   - `RedditSpider`: The main spider class that inherits from `scrapy.Spider`.
   - `name`: The unique identifier for the spider.
   - `allowed_domains`: List of domains that the spider is allowed to scrape.
   - `start_urls`: List of URLs where the spider will begin to crawl.
   - `parse`: The default callback method that processes the HTTP response.
   - `parse_item`: If created, a method to process and extract data from the page.

Shared function names:
- `parse`
- `parse_item` (if implemented)

Shared data schemas:
- `RedditItem` fields (e.g., `title`, `author`, `comments`, etc.)

Shared message names:
- Not typically applicable unless custom signals or logging messages are implemented.

Shared ID names of DOM elements:
- These would be specific to the Reddit HTML structure and are not predefined. They would be identified during the development of the spider and used in the selectors (e.g., `div.post`, `span.title`, etc.).

Shared exported variables:
- `BOT_NAME`
- `SPIDER_MODULES`
- `NEWSPIDER_MODULE`
- `USER_AGENT`
- `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY`
- `ITEM_PIPELINES`

Note: The actual names of the shared dependencies, such as `RedditItem` fields, middleware class names, and spider names, are placeholders and should be defined according to the specific requirements of the web scraping project.
